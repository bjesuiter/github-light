# AGENTS.md

## Rules
- Use the `bgproc` skill to start development servers so process lifecycle is managed (`start`, `status`, `logs`, `stop`).
- Use the `agent-browser` skill to run browser tests autonomously without requiring user interaction.
- Use the `playwrighter` skill to run browser tests collaboratively with the user when explicitly requested.
- When using `beansloop`, always use non-interactive testing.
