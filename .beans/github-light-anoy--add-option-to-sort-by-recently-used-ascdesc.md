Add a sort control on the Projects page so repositories can be ordered by recent activity in both directions.

## Checklist
- [ ] Add UI control to choose "Recently used (newest first)" and "Recently used (oldest first)"
- [ ] Apply selected ordering to repository lists within each owner/org group
- [ ] Preserve existing filter behavior and ensure sorting composes with search/archived toggles
- [ ] Add/adjust tests for sorting behavior

## Verification
- [ ] Confirm both sort directions work on the projects page
- [ ] Confirm default sort remains unchanged unless the new option is selected
